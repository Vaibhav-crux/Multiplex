I developed a Python program that allows users to book movie tickets online. The program uses MySQL as the database to store information about the available shows, reserved seats, and cancellation details. The program is designed to handle different scenarios such as housefull shows, shows at different days and times, and user preferences.

One of the key features of this program is its ability to provide users with an intuitive interface for booking movie tickets. Users can easily browse through the available shows and select the one they want to attend. The program then displays information about the show such as its date, time, and available seats. Users can select their preferred seats and proceed to book their tickets.

To ensure that the booking process is smooth and efficient, the program uses a MySQL database to store information about the available shows and reserved seats. When a user books a ticket, the program updates the database to reflect the new reservation. This ensures that other users cannot book the same seat for the same show.

In addition to booking tickets, the program also provides users with the ability to cancel their reservations. If a user decides that they no longer want to attend a show, they can use the program to cancel their reservation. The program updates the database to reflect this cancellation and makes the previously reserved seat available for other users to book.

The program is also designed to handle scenarios where a show is housefull. If all the seats for a particular show have been booked, the program informs users that there are no more available seats. Users can then choose to book tickets for a different show or try again at a later time.

Another important feature of this program is its ability to handle shows at different days and times. The program allows users to browse through shows that are available on different days and at different times. This makes it easy for users to find a show that fits their schedule.

In terms of user preferences, the program provides users with several options for customizing their booking experience. For example, users can specify their preferred seat type (e.g., aisle or window) and the program will try to reserve a seat that matches their preference. Users can also specify if they want to receive notifications about upcoming shows or special promotions.

Overall, this Python program provides users with a convenient and user-friendly way to book movie tickets online. By using a MySQL database to store information about available shows and reserved seats, the program ensures that the booking process is smooth and efficient. The programâ€™s ability to handle different scenarios such as housefull shows and user preferences makes it a versatile tool for booking movie tickets.
